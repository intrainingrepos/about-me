    <h1>About Siobhan</h1>

        <p>
        Here is a webpage that I have developed so that you can get a feel of the experience
        that I have with HTML. I still have a lot to learn still and skills to really
        make shine! I am on my way to becoming the amazing developer I know I am going to be!
        Please stay tuned as I grow and am able to show you the progession I make along
        this coding journey! 
        </p>

    <h2>My Portfolio</h2>

        <p>
        Since I am still new to the coding world and still going down my path to becoming
        a developer, I dont have much of a portfolio. Like I said previously, I do have a couple
        webpages that I have developed. One as a team and then the other for fun as a side 
        project to help educate myself and grow. As I keep coding and learnng more about 
        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript I will be able to show you more amazing work that is yet
        to come! Though for the time being here is a link to some work that I have done so far.
        </p>

    <h2>Bio</h2>
            
        <p>
        There is a lot to know about me, though when it comes to my experience with HTML
        I am not an expert, not yet. I have some intro level experience with developing webpages
        for informational guidance and also for fun! I have done a lot of research to help 
        teach myself as well and to become more intuned with the functions you can use to create
        a creative base for your webpage. I would say that I have a calling for web development
        and can't wait to learn more, struggle, and become a stronger and more educated 
        developer! Some education that I have when it comes to coding is that I have taken 
        courses 101 and also 102 with Code Fellows to break the ice and get my feet wet with 
        coding. I have also done approximatley 50 hours of online training with Khan Academy,
        working on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goals that I have from graduating from Code Fellows
        is to become a great developer and go on to working for Microsoft creating webpages.
